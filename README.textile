h1. Endtable

A ridiculously simple Object Mapper for Node running on top of CouchDB.

h2. Known Issues

* [FIXED] When running all specs periodic failures seem to be occurring. I think this is related to asynchronous tests and timing issues, the problem should however be investigated.
** I seem to have narrowed the issue down to being caused by automatic view creation when two views are created simultaneously.
* [FIXED] Periodically a document appears to fail to load, causing a spec to fail.
** Synchronously saving documents seems to have fixed this problem.
* Some IO operations do not fail gracefully, I would like to find a way to intercept these operations.
** Currently connecting to CouchDB with an invalid host or port will cause it to explode.

h2. Contributing

# Fork the Endtable repo on Github.
# Write a spec in */spec* that explains the behavior you are fixing and/or adding.
# Write the corresponding code to fix the issue.
# run __> node spec/all-specs.js__ to run all the specs (you will need a local copy of CouchDB running)
# Send a pull request.

h2. Ideas

* I would like to potentially run the underlying CouchDB driver behind a sub-process to protect against failures.
* I would like to abstract the Getter/Setter hooks out further in preparation for adding validation hooks.
