A ridiculously simple ORM for Node running on top of CouchDB.

h2. Known Issues

* [FIXED] When running all specs periodic failures seem to be occurring. I think this is related to asynchronous tests and timing issues, the problem should however be investigated.
** I seem to have narrowed the issue down to being caused by automatic view creation when two views are created simultaneously.
* Periodically a document appears to fail to load, causing a spec to fail.
** This seems to occur frequently with the assertion against the name 'Mark Twain.
